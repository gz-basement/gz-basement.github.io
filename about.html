				<h2>about</h2>
		
		Ground Zero (GZ) is a student-run organization dedicated to promoting music and art at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" target="_blank">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> of Troy, NY. We run an on-campus music venue where we hold open mics, film fests, art shows and other events throughout the school year. As a club independent of the RPI Student Union, our activities are funded by member dues, event income, fundraising and donations alone.
			
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>history</h2>
		
			Ground Zero was founded in the spring of 2001 as a cooperative project between the <a href="https://reslife.rpi.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Student Living and Learning</a> and a group of students who wanted to introduce the concept of "Theme Housing" to RPI. Theme housing, which typically takes a group of students with a similar interest and places them together in regular school housing, is seen as a solution to the problem that upperclassmen residence halls lack the sense of community and liveliness found in freshmen residence halls. <br><br>
			The founding members of Ground Zero felt that the musical and artistic scenes on campus were lacking, so they decided to focus their theme house on those ideas. The group named itself "Ground Zero" to portray the organization as a central point of activity on campus. Nugent Hall was selected as the site of Ground Zero, and plans were implemented to turn it into a student-run venue. <br><br>
			In the fall of 2001, the first Ground Zero members moved in. The basement, which had served as a computer laboratory in the 80s, was gutted, repainted, and brought up to code. A stage was built, and modern lighting and sound equipment was installed. The basement officially became a working venue when construction was completed in fall 2002.
			Eventually, things changed, and we had to relocate to EC4. Later, our partnership with the Office of Student Living and Learning ended due to updated risk management expecations. Nowadays our events are still on campus, just not in student housing.
			Now that Ground Zero is open, there are <a href="events.html">events</a> taking place every week. For more information, come to an event! You can even contact the <a href="mailto:gzshows@gmail.com">Booking Manager</a> to schedule an event of your own. <br><br>
